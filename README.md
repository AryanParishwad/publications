#### Abstract
> Driver drowsiness is a significant factor contributing to road accidents and fatalities worldwide, prompting the need for reliable detection systems to enhance road safety. This comprehensive review explores advancements in deep learning techniques for driver drowsiness detection, evaluating the efficacy of various approaches, including behavioural, physiological, and vehicular measures. [cite_start]The review highlights the potential of deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and hybrid models, in analyzing complex data, improving feature extraction, and achieving high accuracy.
